Three different pages for a **coffee shop website** to demonstrate each of the **XSS vulnerabilities**:

1. **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)**
2. **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS)**
3. **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)**

I'll outline each scenario with a **vulnerable website page**, explain how each XSS works, and give a potential use case where the vulnerability could be exploited.

### 1. **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS)**

In **Reflected XSS**, the malicious input is immediately reflected back to the user by the web server without any sanitization. This happens when the input is processed and returned by the web server.

#### Use Case: **"Search Bar" in the Coffee Shop Website**
A user can search for their favorite coffee or a menu item, and the search term is reflected back on the page.

**Vulnerable PHP Page (search.php)**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Coffee Shop - Search</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Coffee Shop - Search Menu</h1>

    <form action="search.php" method="GET">
        <label for="search">Search for your favorite coffee:</label>
        <input type="text" id="search" name="query" />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>

    <h3>Your Search Results:</h3>
    <p>
        <?php
        if (isset($_GET['query'])) {
            echo "You searched for: " . $_GET['query'];  // This is vulnerable to reflected XSS
        }
        ?>
    </p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Scenario:
1. An attacker could craft a URL like:
   ```
   http://localhost/search.php?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
2. When the victim clicks on the link, the script executes, showing an alert box. The attacker could inject a more harmful payload (e.g., stealing cookies).

**Potential Damage**:
- Stealing session cookies.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.

---

### 2. **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS)**

> [!NOTE]
> In this scenario, you need to create a `reviews.txt` file at the same directory as `review.php`
> Also make sure that `reviews.txt` has write permission for Apache
>
> Steps:
> `sudo touch reviews.txt`
> `sudo chmod 777 reviews.txt`

In **Stored XSS**, the attackerâ€™s input is saved to the server and reflected back to all users who visit the page. It can persist across different sessions and affect multiple users.

#### Use Case: **"Customer Reviews" Section on the Coffee Shop Website**
The coffee shop allows users to leave reviews on different drinks, but the website doesn't sanitize the input before saving it to the database.

**Vulnerable PHP Page (review.php)**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Coffee Shop - Reviews</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Customer Reviews</h1>

    <form action="review.php" method="POST">
        <label for="review">Leave a review:</label>
        <textarea id="review" name="review"></textarea>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <h3>Latest Reviews:</h3>
    <div id="reviews">
        <?php
        // Assume this is getting reviews from a database
        if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
            $review = $_POST['review'];
            // Vulnerable: The review is saved without sanitization
            file_put_contents('reviews.txt', $review . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
        }

        // Display reviews
        $reviews = file('reviews.txt');
        foreach ($reviews as $review) {
            echo "<p>" . $review . "</p>"; // This is where the malicious script can run
        }
        ?>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Scenario:
1. An attacker submits a review like this:
   ```html
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
2. The review is stored in the `reviews.txt` file and will appear for any user who visits the reviews page. When any user views the page, the injected script executes.

**Potential Damage**:
- If the attacker injects malicious JavaScript, they could steal session cookies, hijack accounts, or perform other malicious actions.
- This could impact all users visiting the reviews section.

---

### 3. **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)**

In **DOM-based XSS**, the client-side JavaScript itself handles and processes user input, and the vulnerability arises due to improper handling of the data on the client side, without any server interaction.

#### Use Case: **"Coffee Recommendation" Based on User Input**
The coffee shop website uses JavaScript to give recommendations based on user input (e.g., favorite coffee flavor).

**Vulnerable HTML Page (recommendation.html)**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Coffee Shop - Coffee Recommendation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Coffee Shop - Find Your Perfect Coffee</h1>

    <label for="flavor">Enter your favorite coffee flavor:</label>
    <input type="text" id="flavor" name="flavor">
    <button onclick="getRecommendation()">Get Recommendation</button>

    <h3>Your Recommendation:</h3>
    <div id="recommendation"></div>

    <script>
        function getRecommendation() {
            var flavor = document.getElementById('flavor').value;

            // Vulnerable: inserting input into HTML without sanitization (DOM-based XSS)
            document.getElementById('recommendation').innerHTML = 
                "We recommend the " + flavor + " latte!<br>";

            // Added example: Injecting another XSS vulnerability in the HTML context.
            document.getElementById('recommendation').innerHTML += 
                "<img src='invalid.jpg' onerror='alert(\"XSS via Image\")' />";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```
Expected Outcome:

    When you input <script>alert('XSS')</script>, it won't trigger an alert, but the vulnerable code will still insert the input into the DOM.
    The XSS payload won't be executed directly, but the onerror event in the <img> tag will still trigger the alert because the image fails to load.
    The alert box should pop up with the message: "XSS via Image".
#### Scenario:
1. An attacker could submit a malicious flavor like:
   ```html
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
2. When you input <script>alert('XSS')</script>, it won't trigger an alert, but the vulnerable code will still insert the input into the DOM.
- The XSS payload won't be executed directly, but the onerror event in the <img> tag will still trigger the alert because the image fails to load.
- The alert box should pop up with the message: "XSS via Image".

**Potential Damage**:
- The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript, which could lead to session hijacking, redirecting the user to phishing sites, or other malicious actions.
- Since this happens on the client-side, the attack only requires the victim to interact with the page.

### Summary of the Three Vulnerabilities:

1. **Reflected XSS**:
   - Occurs when user input is reflected immediately by the server (e.g., via a search bar).
   - Example: An attacker could send a link with a malicious payload that runs in the user's browser when clicked.

2. **Stored XSS**:
   - Occurs when malicious input is stored by the server (e.g., in a review or comment section).
   - Example: An attacker submits a review with a malicious script, and every user who views the review will have their browser execute the script.

3. **DOM-based XSS**:
   - Occurs when client-side JavaScript processes unsanitized user input (e.g., a recommendation form).
   - Example: A user enters a malicious input that gets inserted directly into the page via `innerHTML`, allowing for script execution.

---

### Demonstration:
To demonstrate these vulnerabilities, you can:
1. **Set up each of these PHP or HTML pages** on your local server.
2. Test each scenario:
   - **For Reflected XSS**: Enter a search query like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
   - **For Stored XSS**: Submit a review like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
   - **For DOM-based XSS**: Enter a flavor like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in the input field.

These examples will help showcase the dangers of XSS and why proper sanitization, validation, and encoding are crucial to protect web applications from such attacks.
